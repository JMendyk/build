# Notes and experiments on build systems

The current work is to define the semantics of build systems. There are four main components:

* [Store](https://github.com/snowleopard/build-systems/blob/master/src/Development/Build/Store.hs)
* [Plan](https://github.com/snowleopard/build-systems/blob/master/src/Development/Build/Plan.hs)
* [Compute](https://github.com/snowleopard/build-systems/blob/master/src/Development/Build/Compute.hs)
* [Build](https://github.com/snowleopard/build-systems/blob/master/src/Development/Build.hs)

To learn more about the motivation behind the project, read
