\section{Conclusions}\label{sec-conclusions}

We have investigated multiple build systems, showing how their properties are
consequences of two implementation choices: what order you build in and how you
decide whether to rebuild. By first decomposing the pieces, we show how to
recompose the pieces to find new points in the design space. In particular, a
simple recombination leads to a design for a monadic suspending cloud build
system, which we have implemented and use in our day-to-day development.
