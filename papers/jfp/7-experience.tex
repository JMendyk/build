\subsection{Cloud Shake}\label{sec-cloud-shake}

\begin{itemize}
\item Implemented and released
\item Absolute paths and system binaries
\item Deferred materialisation. Different invariants for (a) local builds, (b) cloud sharing (you must list all the things you produce), (c) sharing + deferred materialisation (you must declare all the things you consume). Interaction with early cut-off.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cloud Hadrian}

\begin{itemize}
\item  Real-life example
\item Many examples demonstrating the use of dynamic dependencies
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experience}

\begin{itemize}
\item  Cloud stuff needed tracing infrastructure to expose dependencies.
\item  Good profiling support (here are pictures) exposes places where we are over-sequential, and over-big tasks (build systems work best with lots of small tasks).
\item Ability to compute critical paths
\item Numbers: no-op rebuild time; fresh clone rebuild time; (vs clean build).
\end{itemize}
