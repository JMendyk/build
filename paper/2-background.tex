\section{Background}\label{sec-background}

Build systems automate the execution of repeatable tasks for individual users
and large organisations. In this section we explore the design space of build
systems, using four concrete examples: \Make~\cite{feldman1979make},
\Shake~\cite{mitchell2012shake}, \Bazel~\cite{bazel}, and
\Excel~\cite{advanced_excel}\footnote{\Excel appears very different to the
others but, seen through the lens of this paper, it is very close indeed.}.
We have carefully chosen these four to illustrate the various axes on which
build systems differ; we discuss many other notable examples of build systems,
and their relationships, in~\S\ref{sec-related}.

\subsection{The venerable \Make: static dependencies and file modification times}
\label{sec-background-make}

\Make\footnote{There are numerous implementations of \Make and none comes with a
formal specification. In this paper we therefore use a simple and sensible
approximation to a real \Make that you might find on your machine.} was developed
more than 40 years ago to automatically build software libraries and executable
programs from source code. It uses \emph{makefiles} to describe tasks (often
referred to as \emph{build rules}) and their dependencies in a simple textual form.
For example:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{makefile}
util.o: util.h util.c
    gcc -c util.c
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{makefile}
main.o: util.h main.c
    gcc -c main.c
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{makefile}
main.exe: util.o main.o
    gcc util.o main.o -o main.exe
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
The above makefile lists three tasks: (i) compile a utility library comprising
files \cmd{util.h} and \cmd{util.c} into \cmd{util.o} by
executing\footnote{In this example we pretend \cmd{gcc} is a pure function for
the sake of simplicity. In reality, there are multiple versions of \cmd{gcc}
and the actual binary used to compile and link files, and standard libraries
such that \cmd{stdio.h}, are often also listed as dependencies.} the command
\cmd{gcc -c util.c}, (ii) compile the main source file \cmd{main.c} into
\cmd{main.o}, and (iii) link object files \cmd{util.o} and \cmd{main.o} into the
executable \cmd{main.exe}. The makefile contains the complete information about
the \emph{task dependency graph}, which is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-make}(a).

\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{A task dependency graph and two build scenarios. Input files are shown
in rectangles, intermediate and output files are shown in rounded rectangles.
Modified inputs and files that are rebuilt are highlighted.
\label{fig-make}}
\vspace{-2mm}
\end{figure}

If the user runs \Make specifying \cmd{main.exe} as the desired output, \Make
will first build \cmd{util.o} and \cmd{main.o}, in any order since these
tasks are independent, and then build \cmd{main.exe}. If the
user modifies the sources of \cmd{util.h} and runs \Make again, it will
perform a \emph{full rebuild}, because all three tasks transitively depend on
\cmd{util.h}, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig-make}(b). On the other hand, if
the user modifies \cmd{main.c} then a \emph{partial rebuild} is sufficient:
the file \cmd{util.o} does not need to be rebuilt, since its inputs have not
changed, see Fig.~\ref{fig-make}(c). Note that if the dependency graph is
\emph{acyclic} then each task needs to be executed at most once. Cyclic task
dependencies are typically not allowed in build systems although there are rare
exceptions, see~\S\ref{sec-iterative-compute}.

The following property is essential for build systems; indeed, it is their raison d'\^etre:

\definition[Minimality]{A build system is \emph{minimal} if it executes tasks at
most once per build and only if they transitively depend on inputs that changed
since the previous build.}\label{def-minimal}
\vspace{2mm}

To achieve minimality \Make relies on two main ideas: (i) it uses \emph{file
modification times} to detect which files changed\footnote{Technically, you
can fool \Make by altering the modification time of a file without changing its
content, e.g. by using the command \cmd{touch}. \Make is therefore minimal only
under the assumption that you do not do that.}, and (ii) it constructs a task
dependency graph from the information contained in the makefile and executes
tasks in a \emph{topological order}. For a more concrete description
see~\S\ref{sec-implementation-make}.

\subsection{\Excel: dynamic dependencies at the cost of minimality}
\label{sec-background-excel}

\Excel is a build system in disguise. Consider the following simple spreadsheet.

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{text}
A1: 10      B1: A1 + A2
A2: 20
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
There are two input cells \cmd{A1} and \cmd{A2}, and a single task that computes
the sum of their values, writing the result into the cell \cmd{B1}. If either of
the inputs change, \Excel will recompute the result.

Unlike \Make, \Excel does not need to know all task dependencies upfront. Some
dependencies may change \emph{dynamically} according to computation results. For
example:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{text}
A1: 10      B1: INDIRECT("A" & C1)      C1: 1
A2: 20
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
The formula in \cmd{B1} uses the \cmd{INDIRECT} function, which takes a string
and returns the value of the cell with that name.  The string evaluates to
\cmd{"A1"}, so \cmd{B1} evaluates to \cmd{10}. However, the dependencies of the
formula in \cmd{B1} are determined by the value of \cmd{C1}, so there is no
possibility\footnote{In this particular example one might say that the value of
\cmd{C1} is statically known, but imagine that it is the result of a long
computation chain -- its value will only become available during the build.}
of computing the dependency graph before the build starts.

To support dynamic dependencies, \Excel's build engine~\cite{excel_recalc} is
significantly different from \Make. \Excel arranges the cells into a linear
sequence, called the \emph{calc chain}.  During the build, \Excel processes
cells in the calc-chain sequence, but if computing a cell \cmd{C} requires the
value of a cell \cmd{D} that has not yet been computed, \Excel \emph{aborts}
computation of \cmd{C}, moves \cmd{D} before \cmd{C} in the calc chain, and
resumes the build starting with \cmd{D}. When a build is complete, the resulting
calc chain respects all the dynamic dependencies of the spreadsheet. When an
input value (or formula) is changed, \Excel uses the final calc chain from the
\emph{previous} build as its starting point so that, in the common case where
changing an input value does not change dependencies, there are no aborts.
Notice that build always succeeds regardless of the initial calc chain (barring
truly circular dependencies); the calc chain is just an optimisation.
We refer to this algorithm as \emph{restarting}, and will discuss it
in more detail in~\S\ref{sec-implementation-excel}.

Dynamic dependencies complicate minimality.  In the above example, \cmd{B1}
should only be recomputed if \cmd{A1} or \cmd{C1} change, but not if (say)
\cmd{A2} changes; but these facts are not statically apparent. In practice
\Excel implements a conservative approximation to minimality: it recomputes a
formula if~(i)~the formula mentions a changed cell, or~(ii)~the formula uses a
function like \cmd{INDIRECT} whose dependencies are not statically visible,
or~(iii)~the formula itself has changed.

Item (iii) in the above list highlights a distinguishing feature of \Excel: it
is \emph{self-tracking}. Most build systems only track changes of inputs and
intermediate results, but \Excel also tracks changes in the tasks themselves: if
a formula is modified, \Excel will recompute it and propagate the changes.
Self-tracking is uncommon in software build systems, where one often needs to
manually initiate a full rebuild even if just a single build task has changed.
We discuss self-tracking further in~\S\ref{sec-tracking-aspects}.

\vspace{-2mm}
\caption{Dynamic dependencies example: create \cmd{README} and add it to the
list of release documents \cmd{docs.txt}.\label{fig-shake}}
\vspace{-4mm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\Shake: dynamic dependencies with no remorse}
\label{sec-background-shake}

\Shake was developed to solve the issue of dynamic
dependencies~\cite{mitchell2012shake} without sacrificing
the minimality requirement. Building on the \Make example
from~\S\ref{sec-background-make}, we add the following files whose
dependencies are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-shake}(a):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \cmd{LICENSE} is an input text file containing the project license.
    \item \cmd{release.txt} is a text file listing all files that should be in the release. This file
    is produced by concatenating input files \cmd{bins.txt} and \cmd{docs.txt},
    which list all binary and documentation files of the project.
    \item \cmd{release.tar} is the release archive built by executing the
    command \cmd{tar} on the release files.
\end{itemize}

The dependencies of \cmd{release.tar} are not known statically: they are
determined by the content of \cmd{release.txt}, which might not even exist
before the build. Makefiles cannot express such dependencies, requiring problematic
workarounds such as \emph{build phases} \cite{hadrian}.
In \Shake we can express the rule for \cmd{release.tar} as:

\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
"release.tar" %> \_ -> do
    need ["release.txt"]
    files <- lines <$> readFile "release.txt"
    need files
    system "tar" $ ["-cf", "release.tar"] ++ files
\end{minted}

\noindent
We first declare the static dependency on \cmd{release.txt}, then read its
content (a list of files) and depend on each listed file, dynamically. Finally, we specify the
command to produce the resulting archive. Crucially, the archive will only be
rebuilt if one of the dependencies (static or dynamic) has changed. For example,
if we create another documentation file \cmd{README} and add it to
\cmd{docs.txt}, \Shake will appropriately rebuild \cmd{release.txt} and
\cmd{release.tar}, discovering the new dependency, see Fig.~\ref{fig-shake}(b).

\Shake's implementation is different from both \Make and \Excel in two aspects.
First, it uses the dependency graph from the previous build to decide which
files need to be rebuilt. This idea has a long history, going back to
\emph{incremental}~\cite{demers1981incremental},
\emph{adaptive}~\cite{acar2002adaptive}, and
\emph{self-adjusting computations} (see \cite{acar2007selfadjusting} and
\S\ref{sec-related}). Second, instead of aborting and deferring the execution of
tasks whose newly discovered dependencies have not yet been built (as \Excel
does), \Shake \emph{suspends} their execution until the dependencies are brought
up to date. We refer to this task scheduling algorithm as \emph{suspending}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace{-5mm}
\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{fig/shake-example-cutoff.pdf}}
\vspace{-3mm}
\caption{An early cutoff example: if a comment is added to \cmd{main.c}, the
rebuild is stopped after detecting that \cmd{main.o} is unchanged, since this
indicates that \cmd{main.exe} and its dependents do not need to be
rebuilt.\label{fig-cutoff}}
\vspace{-2mm}
\end{figure}

\Shake also supports the \emph{early cutoff optimisation}. When it
executes a task and the result is unchanged from the previous build, it is
unnecessary to execute the dependent tasks, and hence \Shake can stop a build
earlier, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig-cutoff}. Not all build systems support
early cutoff: \Make and \Excel do not, whereas \Shake and \Bazel (introduced
below) do.

\subsection{\Bazel: a cloud build system}
\label{sec-background-bazel}

When build systems are used by large teams, different team members often end up
executing exactly the same tasks on their local machines. A \emph{cloud build
system} can speed up builds dramatically by sharing build results
among team members. Furthermore, cloud build systems allow one to perform
\emph{shallow builds} that materialise only end build products locally, leaving
all intermediates in the cloud. We illustrate shallow cloud builds by an example
in Fig.~\ref{fig-bazel}.

The user starts by downloading the project sources, whose content hashes are
(for simplicity)~1,~2 and~3, and requests to build \cmd{main.exe}, see
Fig.~\ref{fig-bazel}(a,b). By looking up the global history of all previous
builds of the project\footnote{Here we ignore the issue of limited cloud storage
resources for the sake of simplicity; in practice, old entries are regularly
evicted from the storage, as further discussed in~\S\ref{sec-cloud-aspects}.},
the build system finds that someone has already compiled these exact sources
before and the resulting files \cmd{util.o} and \cmd{main.o} had hashes
4~and~5, respectively. Similarly, the build system finds that the hash of the
resulting \cmd{main.exe} was 6 and downloads the actual binary from the shared
cloud storage -- it must be materialised, because it is the end build product.

In the second scenario, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig-bazel}(c), the user modifies the
source file \cmd{util.c}, thereby changing its hash from~1~to~7. The cloud
lookup of the new combination $\{\cmd{util.c}, \cmd{util.h}\}$ fails,
which means that nobody has ever compiled it. The build system must therefore
build \cmd{util.o}, which results in materialising it with a new hash~8. The
combination of hashes of \cmd{util.o} and \cmd{main.o} has not been encountered
before either, therefore the build system first downloads \cmd{main.o} from the
cloud and then builds \cmd{main.exe} by linking the two object files. When the
build is complete, the results can be uploaded to the cloud for future reuse by
other team members.

\Bazel is one of the first examples of openly available cloud build systems.
As of writing, it is not possible to express dynamic dependencies in
user-defined build rules, however some of the predefined build rules require
dynamic dependencies and the internal build engine can cope with them by using
a \emph{restarting} task scheduler, which is similar to that of \Excel but does
not use the calc chain. \Bazel is minimal and supports the early cutoff
optimisation.

To support cloud builds, \Bazel maintains (i) a \emph{content-addressable cache}
that can be used to download a previously built file given the hash of its
content, and (ii) the history of all executed build commands annotated with
observed file hashes. The latter allows the build engine to bypass the execution
of a task, by predicting the hash of the result from the hashes of its
dependencies, and subsequently download the result from the cache. A concrete
implementation is provided in~\S\ref{sec-implementations}.

hashes are needed), (c)~modify \cmd{util.c} and rebuild \cmd{main.exe}, which
requires building \cmd{util.o} (nobody has compiled \cmd{util.c} before) and
downloading \cmd{main.o} (it is needed for linking \cmd{main.exe}). File hashes
are shown in circles, and non-materialised intermediates in dashed rounded

\subsection{Summary}
\label{sec-background-summary}

We summarise differences between four discussed build systems in
Table~\ref{tab-summary}. The column \emph{`persistent build information'} refers
to the information that build systems persistently store between builds:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Make stores file modification times, or rather, it relies on the file
    system to do that.
    \item \Excel stores one dirty bit per cell and the calc chain from the
    previous build.
    \item \Shake stores the dependency graph discovered in the previous build,
    annotated with file content hashes for efficient checking of file changes.
    \item \Bazel stores the content-addressable cache and the history of all
    previous build commands annotated with file hashes. This information is
    shared among all users of the build system.
\end{itemize}

In this paper we elucidate which build system properties are consequences of
specific implementation choices (stored metadata and task scheduling algorithm),
and how one can obtain new build systems with desired properties by recombining
parts of existing implementations. As a compelling example, we demonstrate how
to combine the advantages of \Shake and \Bazel in a cloud build system with
dynamic dependencies, see~\S\ref{sec-implementation-cloud}.
