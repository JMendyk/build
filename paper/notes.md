# Memoization and self-adjusting computation

"More specifically, we show an interesting duality between memoization and
change propagation: memoization performs poorly with deep changes (where
change propagation performs well) and performs well with shallow changes
(where change propagation performs poorly)."

From "A consistent semantics of self-adjusting computation" by Umut Acar et al.
